                <h2>Mumbai Indians</h2>
                <p>
                    Mumbai Indians is the most successful team in the IPL. They won the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 after beating RCB by 31 runs in the final. The team won the double by winning its first IPL title, in 2013, by defeating CSK by 23 runs in the final, and then defeated the Rajasthan Royals by 33 runs to win its second Champions League Twenty20 title later that year. 
                    They won their 2nd IPL title on 24 May 2015 by defeating the CSK by 41 runs in the final and became the third team to win more than one IPL title. On 21 May 2017, they won their third IPL title by defeating the RPS by 1 run in a thrilling final, thus becoming the first team to win three IPL titles.
                    While playing the tournament, they won their 100th T20, becoming the first team to do so. In 2019, they repeated the same feat as they won a record breaking fourth IPL title, by beating CSK by 1 run on 12 May 2019 in IPL Final.

                <h2>Chennai Super Kings</h2>
                <p>
                    The Super Kings have lifted the IPL title thrice (in 2010, 2011 and 2018), and have the best win percentage among all teams in the IPL (61.28)
                    hey hold the records of most appearances in the playoffs (ten) and the Final (eight) of the IPL. They are the only IPL team to qualify for the playoff stage in each edition of their appearance in the league. In addition, they have also won the Champions League Twenty20 in 2010 and 2014.
                    The brand value of the Super Kings in 2019 is estimated to be around ₹732 crore (roughly $104 million), making them the second-most valuable IPL franchise, after Mumbai Indians.

                <h2>Royal Challengers Bangalore</h2>
                <p>
                    The Royal Challengers have never won the IPL but finished runners-up on three occasions between 2009 and 2016. Their lack of success over the years despite the presence of various notable players has earned them the tag of "underachievers."
                    The team holds the records of both the highest and the lowest totals in the IPL – 263/5 and 49 respectively.
                    The Royal Challengers have a huge and passionate fan base all over India and especially in the city of Bangalore. The fans, known to be loyal and vocal in their support, often turn up in large numbers for RCB's home matches turning the stadium into what is called a "sea of red"

The team has qualified for the play-off stage of the tournament in every season since 2016. In 2018, the team reached the finals of the Indian Premier League, but lost to Chennai Super Kings by 8 Wickets, following a century by Shane Watson. The team is considered one of the best bowling sides, often admired for its ability to defend low totals.

                <h2>Kolkata Knight Riders</h2>
                <p>
                    The franchise, which has gained immense popularity due to its association with celebrity owners, qualified for the IPL playoffs for the first time in 2011. They became the IPL champions in 2012, by defeating Chennai Super Kings in the final. They repeated the feat in 2014, defeating Kings XI Punjab.
                    The Knight Riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14).
                    The home venue of the Knight Riders is the iconic Eden Gardens (with the two ends of the crease called the High Court End and the Club House End). Owned by the Cricket Association of Bengal, it was the largest cricket stadium in India and had a seating capacity of over 90,000.
